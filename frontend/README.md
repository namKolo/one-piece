# Frontend

### Introduction
This is one of main parts in this journey. During 1.5 years working as Frontend Developer, I learned a lot about how to build an app. But I have not never built whole app from scratch.

Therefore, this is a good chance to do it myself.

### Branches

I will use `branch` of git to demo each features. I think It is a good choice to visualize the feature.

The `master` branch will combine whole features of another
